Enhanced Features for 85%+ Accuracy
2.1 Advanced Feature Engineering
Player Momentum: Implement 5-match rolling averages for key stats
Track form in batting/bowling/fielding separately
Apply exponential decay to weight recent performances higher
Venue Intelligence: Create venue-specific feature matrices
Map stadium characteristics to player performance
Account for day/night conditions and pitch history
Implement for match types (league vs qualifier/eliminator/final)
Match Context Analysis:
Increase weights for playoffs (qualifier, eliminator, final) performances
Track pressure situation performance (close matches, critical moments

2.2 Model Architecture Improvements
Enhanced Hybrid Model
  # Core predictive ensemble
  models = {
      'xgboost': XGBRegressor(n_estimators=500, max_depth=7, learning_rate=0.05),
      'random_forest': RandomForestRegressor(n_estimators=120, max_depth=12),
      'gradient_boosting': GradientBoostingRegressor(n_estimators=120)
  }
  
  # Add temporal awareness for form prediction
  time_models = {
      'prophet': Prophet(),
      'exponential_smoothing': ExponentialSmoothing()
  }
  
  # Final ensemble weights
  ensemble_weights = {
      'xgboost': 0.6,
      'random_forest': 0.2,
      'gradient_boosting': 0.1,
      'prophet': 0.1
  }

Monte Carlo Team Selection:
10+ simulation iterations for robust team selection
Identifies core players (70%+ selection rate)
Handles variance in predictions with anti-fragile strategy

2.3 Match-specific Optimizations
Pitch Type Adaptation:
Batting-friendly: Boost batsmen and aggressive all-rounders
Bowling-friendly: Enhance bowlers and defensive all-rounders
Balanced: Equal weighting across roles
Stadium-specific Strategies

  stadium_strategies = {
      "M. Chinnaswamy Stadium, Bangalore": {
          "high_scoring": True,
          "spin_friendly": False,
          "role_weights": {'WK': 1.1, 'BAT': 1.3, 'AR': 1.2, 'BOWL': 0.9}
      },
      "Eden Gardens, Kolkata": {
          "high_scoring": False,
          "spin_friendly": True,
          "role_weights": {'WK': 1.0, 'BAT': 1.0, 'AR': 1.1, 'BOWL': 1.3}
      },
      # Additional stadiums...
  }

Match Type Factor:

  match_type_factors = {
      "League": 1.0,  # Standard weighting
      "Qualifier": 1.3,  # Higher stakes, more reliable performances
      "Eliminator": 1.4,  # Pressure situations amplify star players
      "Final": 1.5  # Maximum weight for clutch performers
  }

Implementation Plan
3.1 UI Enhancements
Simplified 5-option interface:
Select Home Team
Select Away Team
Select Pitch Type
Select Stadium
Select Match Type
Results display with:
Team visualization with captain/vice-captain
Player cards with predicted points
Team analytics (credits used, team balance)

3.2 Algorithmic Flow
def predict_team(home_team, away_team, venue, match_type, pitch_type):
    # 1. Load and preprocess player data
    squad_data = get_team_squads([home_team, away_team])
    
    # 2. Create match context
    match_info = {
        'home_team': home_team,
        'away_team': away_team,
        'venue': venue,
        'match_type': match_type,
        'pitch_type': pitch_type
    }
    
    # 3. Engineer features
    enhanced_data = enhance_player_features(squad_data, match_info)
    
    # 4. Predict player points
    player_points = predict_player_points(enhanced_data, match_info)
    
    # 5. Apply match-specific adjustments
    adjusted_points = apply_match_adjustments(player_points, match_info)
    
    # 6. Run Monte Carlo team selection
    team_variations = monte_carlo_team_selection(adjusted_points, 10)
    
    # 7. Select captain and vice-captain
    final_team = select_captain_vice_captain(team_variations['best_team'])
    
    # 8. Return optimized team with analysis
    return format_team_result(final_team, team_variations)

3.3 Critical Performance Features
